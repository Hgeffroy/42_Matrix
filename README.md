# 42_Matrix

## 🎯 Description  
The **42_Matrix** project focuses on implementing a matrix library (and associated operations) to deepen your understanding of linear algebra concepts and C programming.  
Key goals include:  
- Representing matrices and vectors  
- Implementing basic operations: addition, multiplication, transpose, inversion, etc.  
- Handling edge cases (non-square matrices, singular matrices)  
- Ensuring memory safety, performance and adherence to the school’s norm  

## 🚀 Usage

This is a library, you can clone it into your project and use the functions as you need them.

## 📌 Features / Concepts Covered

- Matrix representation in C (dynamic allocation, row/column major)
- Basic matrix operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication
- Advanced operations: transpose, determinant, inversion (when defined)
- Handling of special cases: singular matrices, non-compatible dimensions
- Memory management: allocation, deallocation, avoiding leaks
- Adherence to the 42 school coding norms: limited function length, file size, naming conventions

## 🧪 Testing

Unit tests validate each function in isolation.
Run them via:
```pytest```
